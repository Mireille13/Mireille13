__Projects:__

 [Cedar: Visualization tool for AWS Lambda metrics and logs](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/Cedar) 
● Used AWS-SDK for JavaScript to interface with Lambda, Cloudwatch and IAM through custom API routes providing key insights into user’s metrics displaying data logs in an intuitive manner

● Integrated AWS-STS to generate temporary security credentials in order to gain read-only access to a user’s AWS console, reducing security vulnerabilities through shortened STS token lifecycle

● Harnessed Node.js’ non-blocking I/O model to streamline concurrent requests alongside Express’ unopinionated and flexible framework creating a scalable backend, and utilizing a RESTful design to handle multiple routes and controllers interfacing with AWS Lambda

● Created modular React functional components and Hooks to recycle state logic between components and track key bits of global state across components in combination with Material-UI and Chart.js creating a dynamic single page application (SPA) to cleanly display AWS Lambda function metrics and logs

● Incorporated Jest, SuperTest and React Testing libraries for UI and integration testing ensuring routes deliver correct data, status codes, and content types for early bug detection and overall code-base maintainability

● Implemented NoSQL database for its fast query speed and flexible data modeling, allowing for simple data modification when adding new functionality and efficient user data storage
